Welcome to your Pomodoro Timer project! This CodeSpace comes pre-configured with everything you need.

## Getting Started

2. Wait for everything to get setup... it might take up to 5 minutes. When it's ready you should see an interface that looks a lot like VS Code.

4. **Start the development server:** In the terminal (if one doesn't open automatically, you can go to Terminal--> New Terminal), execute the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the preview:**

   - Click the popup that appears, or
   - Go to the "Ports" tab and click the globe icon next to port 5173

6. **Start coding!**
   - Your main work will be in `src/App.jsx`
   - Styles are in `src/index.css` (using Tailwind CSS)

## What's Included

- ✅ React + Vite (fast development)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- ✅ Prettier (code formatting)
- ✅ Custom VS Code extensions for React development
